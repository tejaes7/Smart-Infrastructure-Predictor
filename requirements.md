# Requirements Document

## Project Title
Smart Public Infrastructure Failure Predictor

## Problem Statement
Public infrastructure failures such as bridge damage, road deterioration, pipeline leaks, and transformer breakdowns cause safety risks, service disruptions, and high emergency repair costs. Existing monitoring systems are largely reactive and fail to provide early predictive insights.

## Objective
To design and develop an AI-driven predictive monitoring system capable of analyzing real-time infrastructure data, detecting anomalies, and forecasting potential failures to enable preventive maintenance.
